A comprehensive, end-to-end Machine Learning web application designed to predict outcomes and scores for Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches in real-time. Built with Python, Flask, and Scikit-Learn, this project uses historical IPL data to generate actionable insights, win probabilities, and advanced match analytics.

## 🔥 Key Features

* **🏆 Match Win Predictor:** Calculates the real-time probability of the batting or bowling team winning based on current match conditions (target, overs left, wickets, etc.).
* **📈 First Innings Score Predictor:** Estimates the final first-innings score using current run rates, wickets lost, and momentum in the last 5 overs.
* **⚡ Advanced Match Analytics:** 
    * **Pressure Meter:** Evaluates the required run rate vs. current run rate to determine batting pressure.
    * **Momentum Analysis:** Tracks performance over the last 30 balls to gauge team momentum.
    * **Chase Difficulty:** Categorizes the required target into dynamic difficulty levels.
* **🎨 Dynamic UI/UX:** Features an interactive, responsive dashboard with automatic team logo updates upon selection, built with Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Machine Learning & Data Processing
* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Scikit-Learn:** Used for training the `RandomForestClassifier` (Win Prediction) and `RandomForestRegressor` (Score Prediction).
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data cleaning, feature engineering, and pipeline processing.
* **Joblib:** For saving and loading the trained machine learning models (`.pkl` files).

### Backend & Web Framework
* **Flask:** Lightweight WSGI web application framework.
* **Gunicorn:** Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX (used for deployment).

### Frontend
* **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript:** Core frontend technologies.
* **Bootstrap 5:** For responsive grids, cards, and styling.
